# Snake-Game
I just made some improvements and added a new feature (game being faster when snake is growing). You can reach the original version of this project from here: https://www.educative.io/blog/javascript-snake-game-tutorial
<p>You can directly download files and open the html one in your browser for play this game.</p>
